## Summary

Pillager is designed to provide a simple means of leveraging Go's strong concurrency model to recursively search directories for sensitive information in files. Pillager does this by standing on the shoulders of [a few giants](#shoulders-of-giants). Once pillager finds files that match the specified pattern, the file is scanned using a series of concurrent workers that each take a line of the file from the job queue and hunt for sensitive pattern matches. The available pattern filters can be found in the `hunt` command's help page.

## Installation

### Go

If you have Go setup on your system, you can install Pillager with `go get`
 
```shell script

## Configuration

### Gitleaks Rules

Pillager provides full support for [Gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) rules. This can either be passed in with a [rules.toml](./rules.toml) file, or you can use the default ruleset by leaving the rules flag blank. 

```toml
# rules.toml
title = "pillager rules"

[[rules]]
description = "AWS Access Key"
regex = '''(A3T[A-Z0-9]|AKIA|AGPA|AIDA|AROA|AIPA|ANPA|ANVA|ASIA)[A-Z0-9]{16}'''
tags = ["key", "AWS"]
[[rules.entropies]]
    Min = "3.5"
    Max = "4.5"
    Group = "1"

[[rules]]
description = "Email Address"
regex = '''(?i)([A-Za-z0-9!#$%&'*+\/=?^_{|.}~-]+@(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?)'''
tags = ["email", "User Info"]
```

### Shoulders of Giants :star:

#### [afero's Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)

**What is Cobra?**

> Cobra is a library providing a simple interface to create powerful modern CLI interfaces similar to git & go tools. Cobra is also an application that will generate your application scaffolding to rapidly develop a Cobra-based application.

If you've seen a CLI written in Go before, there's a pretty high chance it was built with Cobra. I can't recommend this library enough. It empowers developers to make consistent, dynamic, and self-documenting command line tools with ease. Some examples include `kubectl`, `hugo`, and Github's `gh` CLI.

#### [Gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks)

**What is Gitleaks?**

> Gitleaks is a SAST tool for detecting hardcoded secrets like passwords, api keys, and tokens in git repos.

Gitleaks is an amazing tool for secret leak prevention. If you haven't implemented Gitleaks as a pre-commit checker, it's worth your time to check it out. 

**Why is Gitleaks relevant to Pillager?**

Pillager implements the powerful [rules](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks#rules-summary) functionality of Gitleaks while taking a more offensive approach to working with the secrets found. 
While I have provided a baseline set of default rules, Pillager becomes much more powerful if you allow users to create rules for their own use-cases.

> This goes without saying but I'm going to say it anyways: I am **not** responsible for any repercussions caused by your use of pillager. This tool is intended for defensive, Blue Team use.
