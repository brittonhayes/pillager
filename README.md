Pillage filesystems for sensitive information with Go.

## Summary

Pillager is designed to provide a simple means of leveraging Go's strong concurrency model to recursively search
directories for sensitive information in files. Pillager does this by standing on the shoulders
of [a few giants](#shoulders-of-giants). Once pillager finds files that match the specified pattern, the file is scanned
using a series of concurrent workers that each take a line of the file from the job queue and hunt for sensitive pattern
matches. The available pattern filters can be defined in a pillager.toml file or you can use the default ruleset.

## Installation

### Go

If you have Go setup on your system, you can install Pillager with `go install`

```shell script

## Usage

To see all the commands available with `pillager`

```shell
# To see instructions for the entire application
pillager

# From any subcommand
pillager [cmd] --help

## Configuration

### Gitleaks Rules

Pillager provides full support for Gitleaks[^2] rules. This can either be passed
in with a rules[^1] section in your pillager.toml file, or you can use the default ruleset by leaving the config flag blank.

[^1]: [Gitleaks Rules Reference](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/blob/57f9bc83d169bea363f2990a4de334b54efc3d7d/config/gitleaks.toml)

```toml
# pillager.toml
# Basic configuration
verbose = false 
path = "."
workers = 4
redact = false 
reporter = "json-pretty"

# Rules for secret detection
[[rules]]
description = "AWS Access Key"
id = "aws-access-key"
regex = '''(A3T[A-Z0-9]|AKIA|AGPA|AIDA|AROA|AIPA|ANPA|ANVA|ASIA)[A-Z0-9]{16}'''
tags = ["aws", "credentials"]

[[rules]]
description = "AWS Secret Key"
id = "aws-secret-key"
regex = '''(?i)aws(.{0,20})?(?-i)['\"][0-9a-zA-Z\/+]{40}['\"]'''
tags = ["aws", "credentials"]

[[rules]]
description = "GitHub Token"
id = "github-token"
regex = '''ghp_[0-9a-zA-Z]{36}'''
tags = ["github", "token"]

[[rules]]
description = "Private Key"
id = "private-key"
regex = '''-----BEGIN (?:RSA|OPENSSH|DSA|EC|PGP) PRIVATE KEY( BLOCK)?-----'''
tags = ["key", "private"]

# Allowlist configuration
[allowlist]
paths = [
    ".*/_test\\.go$",
    ".*/testdata/.*",
    ".*\\.md$",
    ".*/vendor/.*"
]
regexes = [
    "EXAMPLE_KEY",
    "DUMMY_SECRET"
] 
```

### Built-in Output Formats

Pillager has a series of built-in output formats available. Pick your flavor!

#### Basic

```shell
pillager hunt .
```

#### JSON

```shell
pillager hunt ./example -f json | jq
```

#### Wordlist

```shell
# Use pillager to generate a new-line delimited wordlist from findings
pillager hunt . -f wordlist 
```

```shell
# Use pillager to append a wordlist and then use your favorite hashcat attack mode
pillager hunt ./ -f wordlist >> rockyou.txt && hashcat -a 0 hash.txt rockyou.txt
```

> _JSON output is designed to work seamlessly with the amazing [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) utility for easy parsing._

```

#### HTML

```shell
pillager hunt . -f html > results.html
```

#### Markdown

```shell
pillager hunt . -f markdown > results.md
```

#### Markdown Table

</details>

### Custom Templates

Pillager allows you to use powerful `go text/template` and [sprig](https://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) functions to customize the output format. Here are a few template examples.

#### Basic

```gotemplate
{{ range . -}}
    File: {{ .File }}
    Secret: {{ .Secret}}
    Description: {{ quote .Description }}
{{ end -}}

```

#### Markdown Styling

```gotemplate
# Results

{{ range . -}}
    ## {{ .File }}
    - Location: {{.StartLine}}
{{end}}

```

> More template examples can be found in the [templates](./internal/templates) directory.

### Shoulders of Giants :star:

#### [spf13's Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)

**What is Cobra?**

> Cobra is a library providing a simple interface to create powerful modern CLI interfaces similar to git & go tools.
> Cobra is also an application that will generate your application scaffolding to rapidly develop a Cobra-based application.

If you've seen a CLI written in Go before, there's a pretty high chance it was built with Cobra. I can't recommend this
library enough. It empowers developers to make consistent, dynamic, and self-documenting command line tools with ease.
Some examples include `kubectl`, `hugo`, and Github's `gh` CLI.

#### [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks)

**What is Gitleaks?**

> Gitleaks[^2] is a SAST tool for detecting hardcoded secrets like passwords, api keys, and tokens in git repos.

Gitleaks is an amazing tool for secret leak prevention. If you haven't implemented Gitleaks as a pre-commit checker,
it's worth your time to check it out.

**Why is Gitleaks relevant to Pillager?**

[^2]: [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks)

Pillager implements the powerful [rules](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#rules-summary) functionality of
Gitleaks while taking a different approach to presenting and handling the secrets found. While I have provided a
baseline set of default rules, Pillager becomes much more powerful if you allow users to create rules for their own
use-cases.

Check out the included rules[^1] for a baseline ruleset.
